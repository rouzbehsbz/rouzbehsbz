I think I’m just really curious about how this machine called a computer actually works! I feel like I could enjoy the complexity of this human-made system until the day I die.

You’d make me really happy if you checked out my YouTube channel, ***[DevDrug](https://www.youtube.com/@devdrug)*** ! I’m trying to create content there about deep concepts of software engineering and computer science, or as they say, “*making drugs for developers*” :)

Things I’m interested in or working on right now — feel free to reach out if you’d like to talk about them:
- ⚙️ SVM based Blockchains (Optimization)
- 🌐 Networking Stacks (TCP/IP, QUIC, Compression, Weak Consistency)
- 🎮 Game Engines (Emulators, Compilers, Lua, Physics Engine, Graphics)
