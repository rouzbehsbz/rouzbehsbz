## Hey 👋, I'm Rouzbeh!

I think I’m just really curious about how this machine called a computer actually works! I feel like I could enjoy the complexity of this human-made system until the day I die.

You’d make me really happy if you checked out my YouTube channel, ***[DevDrug](https://www.youtube.com/@devdrug)*** ! I’m trying to create content there about deep concepts of software engineering and computer science, or as they say, “*making drugs for developers*” :)

feel free to [contact](https://t.me/rouzbehsbz) me if you want.
